The diversity of color mechanisms and color patterns are axes of diversity to consider within speciation and evolutionary history, however the overall diversity has never been quantified broadly across fishes. Although previous studies have linked diversity of color and color patterns in reef fish to factors ranging from sexual selection and communication with conspecifics to predator-prey interactions, these hypotheses have not been tested in a comparative macroevolutionary framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
